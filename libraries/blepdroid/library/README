Compiling this requires a few things:

Eclipse
Android SDK 20+
Processing libraries

I just used the Processing Android template found here https://github.com/processing/processing-android-library-template to create the Eclipse project, it's highly recommended.

Build, drop it in the libraries folder, and you should be good to go.
